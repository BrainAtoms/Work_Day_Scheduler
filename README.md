# Work Day Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler was created as a resource for people to schedule their current day by the hour. Users can schedule what they need to do for each hour and the save it to the page so that they come back and check their schedule. Each hour includes a text area that is color coded to remind users whether the hour is in the past, present or future. This web page uses HTML and CSS to appear neat and presentable to users. The website also uses Javascript to give the user a sastisfying interactive experience.
